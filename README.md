# Quiz Game

## Introduction
The **Quiz Game** is a command-line-based application designed to offer a fun and interactive way to test your knowledge. The game allows players to register, answer a set of multiple-choice questions, and view their scores. It also includes a scoreboard to track scores for all participants.

## Features
- **Player Registration**: Players can register their names before playing the quiz.
- **Quiz Gameplay**: A randomized set of questions is presented with four answer options each.
- **Scoring System**: Players earn points for correct answers, with feedback provided after each question.
- **Scoreboard**: Displays the scores of all players after the quiz ends.
- **File-Based Questions**: Questions are stored in an external file (`questions.txt`) for easy customization.

## How It Works
1. Players are welcomed and asked to register their names.
2. A set of questions is loaded from the `questions.txt` file.
3. Questions are displayed one by one, and players choose their answers by entering the corresponding option number.
4. The playerâ€™s score is calculated based on the number of correct answers.
5. The final score is displayed, and a scoreboard shows scores of all participants.

## File Format for Questions
The `questions.txt` file should have questions formatted as follows:
```
Question;Option1;Option2;Option3;Option4;CorrectOptionNumber
```
Example:
```
